# Custom iOS AlertView

`v0.9.3`

`support for both iOS7 and iOS8`

The addSubview is not available in UIAlertView in iOS7 or iOS8 any more. The view hierarchy for this class is private and must not be modified.

As a solution, this class creates an iOS-style dialog which you can extend with any UIViews or buttons. The animations and the looks are copied too and no images or other resources are needed.

## Install

As simple as adding the following files to your project:

* CustomIOSAlertView.h
* CustomIOSAlertView.m

Or use CocoaPods:

```
pod 'CustomIOSAlertView', '~> 0.9.3'
```

## Change notes

* Fixed rotation for IOS8

* Removed 7 from the class name. Just use CustomIOSAlertView from now on, like: [[CustomIOSAlertView alloc] init];

* The initWithParentView method is now deprecated. Please use the init method instead, where you don't need to pass a parent view at all. **In case the init doesn't work for you, please leave a note or open an issue here.**

## Quick start guide

1. Create the UIView object `changed`

    ```
    CustomIOSAlertView *alertView = [[CustomIOSAlertView alloc] init];
    ```

2. Add some custom content to the alert view (optional)

    ```
    UIView *customView ..;

    [alertView setContainerView:customView];
    ```

3. Display the dialog

    ```
    [alertView show];
    ```

## More functions

* Close the dialog

    ```
    [alertView close];
    ```

* To add more buttons, pass a list of titles

    ```
    [alertView setButtonTitles:[NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"Button1", @"Button2", @"Button3", nil]];
    ```

* You can remove all buttons by passing nil

    ```
    [alertView setButtonTitles:NULL];
    ```

* You can enable or disable the iOS7 parallax effects on the alert view

    ```
    [alertView setUseMotionEffects:TRUE];
    ```

* Handle button clicks with a custom delegate

    First, set the delegate:

    ```
    [alertView setDelegate:self];
    ```

    Then add the delegate methods:

    ```
    - (void)customIOS7dialogButtonTouchUpInside: (CustomIOSAlertView *)alertView clickedButtonAtIndex: (NSInteger)buttonIndex
    {
        NSLog(@"Button at position %d is clicked on alertView %d.", buttonIndex, [alertView tag]);
    }
    ```

* Handle button clicks with a code block

    ```
    [alertView setOnButtonTouchUpInside:^(CustomIOSAlertView *alertView, int buttonIndex) {
        NSLog(@"Block: Button at position %d is clicked on alertView %d.", buttonIndex, [alertView tag]);
        [alertView close];
    }];
    ```

    You can also disable all other delegates by:

    ```
[alertView setDelegate:self];
    ```

## Todos

This is a really quick implementation, and there are a few things missing:

* Adding more buttons: they don't exactly match the look with that of on iOS7

* Rotation: rotates wrong with the keyboard on
